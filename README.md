I am currently internship as an AI/ML intern at Nexus software for a period of three months. I will be tasked to do 6 projects throughout the span of three months to work on projects from various fields like artificial intelligence and software development.
This repository is to store the projects for submission and evaluation by the internship authorities.
Thank you for stopping by!
